swarms spawning too close
buildings not sinking

missile launching
orbital laser cannon; push asteroids or vaporize fragments...... maybe automatically tries to vaporize fragments?
orbital space telescope

require funding to build stuff?
receive funding from spotting things in the sky with telescopes
telescopes search for objects in a specific sector of the sky: more telescopes give better coverage and increase the chance of spotting objects in a given sector
finding objects early gives you more time to prepare

destroying objects also grants you funding

asteroid impacts damage planetary infrastructure and destroy buildings
major asteroid impacts can cause a nuclear winter, resulting in a game-over

add vfx for when rb is slowing down in the atmosphere

make asteroids sink into the ground upon collision

add vfx for atmospheric entry; plasma glow leading the object; sparks trailing the object

prevent spawning fragments when colliding with a major body (planets, moons), only do so when colliding with a missile

combine attractable and attractor into a single class? , control with a canAttractBodies flag? might cause physics instability because of order of execution getting mixed up 

maybe create a single impact effect that can be heavily configured on the fly to account for impacts of all kinds; small flashes, big ejecta, massive planet killers...
alternatively, create a bunch of effects and add them as a list to AsteroidSpawner which will give you the correct one depending on your body

TODO LIST
- Scrap the asteroid swarm system, spawn individual asteroids/fragments that are either "orbital" or "flyby"
- Add a funds system, building missiles costs funds
- You gain funds over time
- You gain 1000 funds for destroying an asteroid, 500 if an asteroid collides with the planet
- The planet has a health that slowly regenerates, 0 health -> defeat
