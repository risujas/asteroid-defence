missile launching
orbital laser cannon; push asteroids or vaporize fragments
orbital space telescope

require funding to build stuff?
receive funding from spotting things in the sky with telescopes
telescopes search for objects in a specific sector of the sky: more telescopes give better coverage and increase the chance of spotting objects in a given sector
finding objects early gives you more time to prepare

destroying objects also grants you funding

asteroid impacts damage planetary infrastructure and destroy buildings
major asteroid impacts can cause a nuclear winter, resulting in a game-over

fix issue with timescale being 0 upon game start



TODO LIST
- Add a better collision system for the missile, for example, scrap the "collision enabler" and give it permanent collision but require a minimum impact relative velocity. Requires calculating the moon velocity
- Scrap the asteroid swarm system, spawn individual asteroids/fragments that are either "orbital" or "flyby"
- Add a funds system, building missiles costs funds
- You gain funds over time
- You gain 1000 funds for destroying an asteroid, 500 if an asteroid collides with the planet
- The planet has a health that slowly regenerates, 0 health -> defeat
