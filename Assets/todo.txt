tooltips for planets, asteroids, objects (static on the screen, with a line pointing towards the object)

		   BERTHA
		   A habitable planet home to a thriving, space exploring civilization.
		   Average temperature: 17 C
		   Infrastructure level: 89%

orbital laser cannon; push asteroids or vaporize fragments...... maybe automatically tries to vaporize fragments?
orbital space telescope
orbital railgun, launches metal slugs to hit fragments
scifi gravity reflector

receive funding from spotting things in the sky with telescopes
telescopes search for objects in a specific sector of the sky: more telescopes give better coverage and increase the chance of spotting objects in a given sector
finding objects early gives you more time to prepare

asteroid impacts damage planetary infrastructure and destroy buildings
major asteroid impacts can cause a nuclear winter, resulting in a game-over

add vfx for when rb is slowing down in the atmosphere
make asteroids sink into the ground upon collision
add vfx for atmospheric entry; plasma glow leading the object; sparks trailing the object

fix missile jitter

WORLD TYPE:
inhabitable planet around a gas giant?

SPECIAL EVENTS
	- "Rogue star": a bright star will pass across the background, depicting another star that passed through the Oort cloud and foretelling a massive asteroid swarm in the future
	- "Unnatural asteroid": a strange glowing asteroid that can erratically change its direction or accelerate. Can dodge missiles
	- "Comet": an asteroid with a long growing tail passes through the system
	- "Solar flare" temporarily disables systems
	- "Unidentified space object" - seemingly a mechanical construct, it observes your planet for a while and then darts away

maybe allow spawning new asteroids groups as soon as the previous one has reached a distance near the earth, instead of when the culling has started. makes group spawning more frequent and reduces waiting?

TODO LIST
- Eventually, maybe add a dynamic difficulty that makes the game more challenging depending on how well you are doing

add temperature gauge next to the planet health UI

- Improved camera:
	Allow panning around the planet somehow

- Maybe some items (missiles etc) require a baseline health to use? maybe not fun though





fade UI in and out as needed
for example, when defeated, slow fade the game UI away, then fade in the defeat screen

show stats screen on defeat screen

add a strong vignette effect during defeat screen

fade to black when reloading scene


maybe have missiles start below ground and emerge from it

add multiple levels of missile tech
level 1: dumb missiles: fire and forget, straight path
level 2: controllable missiles: all missiles fly towards mouse cursor when a button is held
level 3: locking missiles: missiles automatically target nearby major asteroids and set themselves on a collision course

add a tech menu where you unlock new tech
for example, pay 1000 funds to unlock higher level missile tech
